#Introduction

MarketStudy is an iOS application for use on the iPhone that gives users information about the housing and demographic 
characteristics of the area around a given address using data from the U.S. Census, and the ability to use this data to
calculate land value.arketStudy does not undertake any analysis aside from computing land value based on user inputs. 
The app only exists for convenience. Two scenarios for its use come to mind: if a developer is in the field and wants 
to do pencil out projections of whether or not a project will be profitable, and in a land purchase negotiation
where a developer quickly needs to adjust their pencil out model to accommodate for fluctuating land price offers.
